The upper bound is 999x999 = 998001
the lower bound is 100x100 = 10000

is it better to generate palindromes and test their factors, or to generate 3-digit factors and test if their products are palindromes?	

Assume generation of palindromes:
	How do I test if something is the product of two 3-digit numbers?
	Largest possible factor of X is <= sqrt(X)
	starting from sqrt(X), test sequentially smaller numbers A to see if they factor x.
	X/a = b + r
	if r is 0 and a and b are both 3-digit, we win
	
	if a gets smaller than 3 digit or b gets larger than 3 digit, quit and go to the next X
	
Generating palindromes:
	six digits:  generate 3-digit numbers, reverse, multiply by 1000, concatenate.
	since we're looking to generate the largest, start with 997  (makes 997799) and count down by 1
	
	if short num w is 997
	long num is 
	short/100 (ones)
	+ (short%100) (tens)
	+ (short%10) * 100 (hundreds)
