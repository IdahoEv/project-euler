The routes to any point in the square can be found by seeing it as a rotated slice out of pascal's triangle:

3x3 square:
01 01 01 01
01 02 03 04
01 03 06 10
01 04 10 20

if the upper left corner is row 0, then the bottom right corner is a single term (the biggest term) out of row 2n for an nxn square.
